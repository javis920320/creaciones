and illustrated between twenty and thirty science-fiction shōjo targeted towards girls short stories for manga contests held by manga magazines, with one of them earning an honorable mention Terasawa created Cobra by combining the spaghetti western subgenre and Japanese stories featuring a "wandering swordman"13 Terasawa wanted to create a hero who would be able to carry a concealed weapon and then the Psychogun was created before the titular character14 His concept of a hero has been greatly influenced by "spaghetti westerns with a James Bond-type spin to them"13 Also from Bond series came the concept of several women who circulate around Cobra15 For Cobra, he also drew inspiration from the French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo and his "phlegmatic style", specifically from his characters on Breathless 1960 and That Man from Rio 19641617 The then rising actresses Dominique Sanda and Catherine Deneuve also inspired the names of the Royal Sisters16In general, Terasawa has been influenced by films, including Star Trek, René Laloux's animations,16 the James Bond film series, Akira Kurosawa's films, and Disney films prior to The Little Mermaid 1989 For example, Jane Fonda's performance in the cult science-fiction film Barbarella 1968 served as a direct model for his character Jane, whose hairstyle was also inspired by Princess Aurora's in the Disney animated film Sleeping Beauty 1959 For his storytelling, panel layout, and narrative pacing in general, he draws influence from manga artist Osamu Tezuka, who mentored him13 Terasawa declared, "Without him,  Cobra would never have existed17Written and illustrated by Buichi Terasawa, Cobra was first published in 1977 in Shueisha's Japanese shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump as a one-shot edition18 It was later serialized,

released as Cobra GirlsJp 21 on February 1, 198872 Concept designs of the manga were added to a Cobra artbook titled Cobra Wonder: Concept Design Arts of Cobra World, which was released in July 17, 1997, and included two Cobra's side stories—BaraJp 22 and Mahō no FuneJp 23—first published in Super Jump in 19887374 Popy and Bandai included Cobra's ground vehicle, the Psychoroid, in the Japanese Machine Robo toyline, where it gained the ability to transform into a robot Japan later exported this idea to the United States as part of the Super Gobots toyline under the name "Psycho", designed by Murakami Katsushi75 In Japan, action figures,76 T-shirts,77 kewpie dolls,78 Cobra's Psychogun and Crystal Bowie's claw replicas,7980 stamps,81 and limited-edition whiskey bottles were sold as merchandise for the series82In 1982, Popy Electronics created the hand-held games Space Cobra Professional and Space Cobra the Psychogun8384 It was followed by Cobra: Kokuryū Ō no Densetsu, released in 1989 for the PC Engine, and Cobra 2: Densetsu no Otoko, released for the PC Engine in 1990,35 which was released in North America and Europe for the Sega CD as The Space Adventure - Cobra: The Legendary Bandit8586The English version of Cobra was named as one of the "The Top 25 Translated-To-English Manga of All Time" by Wizard magazine87 Ivevei Upatkoon of EX online magazine praised it as a "rich fantasy" that was unmatched by any other She said the main character took "after James Bond, albeit somewhat on the silly side, and the costumes and bizarre worlds are but a shade shy of plagiarizing Barbarella" She was impressed that the series "is surprisingly devoid of the sexual innuendo and exploitation that anime fans have come to associate with decorative female characters"; it avoids the stereotypical, beautiful women, and instead creates its own "extreme" world Upatkoon also said that modern readers might find the manga dated and would be discouraged from reading it, despite the improvement in artistic quality as the series progresses88 Writing for Anime News Network ANN, Jason Thompson described Cobra as "a significant piece of manga history" Thompson wrote that the women of the series have a "realistic physique and not some moe jailbait or grotesque bakunyu explosion" Thompson deemed Cobra as a parody of both Western action heroes and Star Wars and 1970s shōjo science fiction and its concept of beauty"89Pedro Cortes from Japanator affirmed, "Space Adventure Cobra is interesting in that it takes a shard of an idea from a classic and then spins it out into its own epic" Cortes praised its "charming" designs, while criticized the main character lack of development as "the only negative thing" He added, "There isn't a ton of depth, but the show doesn't pretend to be anything but a fun, sci-fi romp around the galaxy"90 ANN's Theron Martin praised its "surprisingly solid" art "for a series of its era" and affirmed, "it does stand up well as high-spirited, fun-loving action fare with occasional darker overtones"91 Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post said, "It's simple but full of adventure, interesting characters and locations and a sense of fun that definitely makes it work in a very good way" and has "a solid visual design"92 Washington, in a review for Otaku USA, commended that it "is entertaining overall" and has "an overall fun vibe" because of it "smooth" art; he, however, criticized what he called "serious misogynistic tendencies"93Chris Beveridge from Maniacom praised the Cobra the Animation anime series and its visual design, comparing to the The Psychogun ones, but said it is not for those who are unaware the original series He said the anime has "a healthy dose of action, the kind of sexuality that's a trademark of the series  as well as a good bit of silly fun"94 In the second episode review, Beveridge said it "seems to be following much the same kind of pace and structure" as the OVAs95 Its animation was compared with the Darkside Blues; ANN's Erin Finnegan said it was a "gritty" animation, but that from episode five, the animation quality looks more modern and much less gritty96 Beveridge said the anime's idea is simple, but added it is "also not a show you see often since it doesn't center around teenagers, schools or the harem concept" He said it is not "a great show", but that "it gives us something different than the usual"—the reason it is "enjoyable"97Cobra made Terasawa, who at the time was 22 and was little known, famous2499 Approximately 40 million copies of Cobra have been sold, making it one of Weekly Shōnen Jump's best-selling manga series of all time100 The anime television series was a major success in France in the 1980s89 Le Monde's Frédéric Potet said it "marked a whole generation of young viewers",17 and Joel Metreau of 20 minutes asserted it gained a cult following16 Alexandre Aja and Luc Besson are among the French filmmakers that are fans of the series16Its humorous style and sexual innuendos influenced City Hunter, and Shinichirō Watanabe's works Cowboy Bebop and Space Dandy owe their nostalgic appearance and the ironic tone, respectively, to Cobra16 Cobra's "provoking look", ironic style and capacity of changing from a little smile to a serious face also inspired video game designer Hideki Kamiya to create the character of Dante from the Devil May Cry series101102Thirty years later, Cobra the Animation has been well received by fans; the OVA was among the best-selling for two weeks, and the sixth volume of the anime series was one of the best-selling DVDs for one week103104105In 2008, Buichi Terasawa said he received a Hollywood offer to purchase the rights to a live-action film adaptation of the series He stated it was "off-the-record", and that if it happened it would be partly standalone and separate from his original manga49 However, in 2010, Alexandre Aja announced he had purchased its rights, and that he planned to direct a live-action film adaptation of Cobra56106 Aja was inspired to create this film adaptation because the original manga was one of his childhood favorites107 Aja said he wanted to create a "tent pole-sized live action franchise"108In 2011, Aja wrote a script with Gregory Levasseur, and production was held by Aton Soumache and Dimitri Rassom under Onyx Films and Studio 37 with a budget of more than $100 million109 Later, a teaser poster depicting promotional concept art for Cobra: The Space Pirate, along with a release date scheduled for mid-2013, was unveiled110 In September 2013, however, Aja admitted that making the film will be "very hard" since "to do a new kind of Star Wars, is expensive" though he stated "we are trying everything, we will make it"98 In July 2014, Aja revealed it was estimated that the project would require a budget of over $150 million, and that he was seeking to have an A-list actor to help attract a funder111 One of his main difficulties, Aja said in 2015, was to decide who would star the film: "When I think 'who the heck is going to play that Cobra', I become unable to move forward"112In a June 2016 interview, Aja said he did not abandon it and that "The project is well advanced"113 Working with the Orange Studio and a group of twenty concept artists, Aja was able "to develop an absolutely huge universe in visual research"113 The main drawback that made him slow the process was the release of Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014, because Aja had to change several aspects of Cobra to differentiate it113114cobra (manga), cobra
